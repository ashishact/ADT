#Aircraft Design Toolbox for Scilab

Aircraft Design Toolbox for Scilab is a library to create conceptual aircraft design using Scilab.

It includes following modules:

1. Requirement:captures top level requirements of an aircraft
2. Weight estimation: measures initial gross weight using historical trends
3. Mission design: captures aircraft mission profile
4. Initial sizing: finds out dimension of the aircraft component
5. Drag : finds out total drag due to all the components
6. Performance analysis: calculates performance to be compared against requirements
